In this model I used Resnet9 architecture to create the Image classification model with this I also used convolution neural network which work great on image classification model
I used Pytorch language to work with this project. 

First,  we apply the noramlization on the dataset so that we can range the value between 0 and 1.
Then we apply convolution neural network to train model so that it able to predict the label of the image correctly.
